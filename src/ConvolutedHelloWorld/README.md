# ConvolutedHelloWorld

The aim of this project is to write a ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) application in C#.

The twist: make it as convoluted as possible.

This will be done by defining a number of methods, each of which returns one or a few characters, which, when joined together, forms the text `Hello, World!`, with that exact capitalization and punctuation.

Goals:

- Print the text `Hello, World!` to the console.
- Avoid reusing the same "tricks", as much as is reasonably possible.
- Each line of code must do something productive. That means, methods or loops that do not contribute to the final result are prohibited.
- Everything must be done entirely within the Base Class Library (BCL). No NuGet packages, no P/Invoke, no depending on the underlying OS or environment.
- Everything else is fair game, no matter if it's bad practice, stupid, or borderline illegal.

## Conclusion
